>   ***Goals***: This package will determine if an existing water tank in a drinking water system has a compatible volume for the current water demand.
> If not, a suitable volume will be given.

>   ***Requirements***: Python libraries: pandas and matplotlib 

## Terminology
As the demand of an area can change with time the needed volume of a water 
tank supplying this area may also change. Therefore, using past daily consumption 
data of the last couple of years as well as the hourly inflow and outflow of the 
water tank on a peak day a new needed volume should be determined.

## Data Import
Using *pandas* the daily consumption of the area will be imported.

## Plausibility check

## Calculating the 3 categories

## Evaluating the current volume
